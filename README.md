# ResearchForToday
 - This is basically ChatGpt for research which can get you concise to the point information about anything. At the same time
   it can even get you information about recent events, which chatGPT canâ€™t.
- It uses Serper libray to get the relevant websites according to the query. Browserless library is used to scrap the websites.
   After all this Langchain with OpenAI API is used to summarise the text with proper references.
- This is the demonstration of how large language models like GPT-3.5 can be used for taking actions on the basis of query.
  

## For setting up the project
- Install all the libraries listed in Requirements.txt
- ADD .env file
- add API keys of OPENAI, BROWSERLESS and SERPER
